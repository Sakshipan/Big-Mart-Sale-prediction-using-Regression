# Big-Mart-Sale-prediction-using-Regression
Nowadays, shopping malls and Big Marts organizations are expanding their businesses globally, so Sales Prediction is a big matter these days for predicting future customer demand. Sales forecasting can assist a company in working and growing in the appropriate path. We propose a regression-based predictive model for Big Mart sales analysis
Currently, supermarket run-centers, Big Marts keep track of each individual item's sales data in order to anticipate potential consumer demand and update inventory management. Anomalies and general trends are often discovered by mining the data warehouse's data store. For retailers like Big Mart, the resulting data can be used to forecast future sales volume using various machine learning techniques like big mart. A predictive model was developed using Linear regression techniques for forecasting the sales of a business such as Big-Mart, and it was discovered that the model outperforms existing models. Linear regression is the basis for many analyses. Sometimes the data need to be transformed to meet the requirements of the analysis, or allowance has to be made for excessive uncertainty in the X variable. Linear regression is usually used to predict the value of the Y variate at any value of the X variate, but sometimes the inverse prediction is needed, based on a different approach. The process of using companies sales record over the past years to predict the sale performance for companiesâ€™ future. This process is known as sale forecasting. Day by day competition among different shopping malls as well as big marts is getting more serious and aggressive only due to the rapid growth of the global malls and on-line shopping. Every mall or mart is trying to provide personalized and short-time offers for attracting more customers depending upon the day, such that the volume of sales for each item can be predicted for inventory management of the organization, logistics and transport service, etc. By keeping all these in mind a Big Mart Sales Data Prediction using linear technique can be used.

This Project will be divided into 5 stages:
1	Predict what is the sales of Big Mart in the upcoming months
2	Plan the Model and import the relevant libraries.
DATA PROCESSING STAGES	
Data Acquisition: Import the required Dataset
3	Data Processing: Load the data and
Concatenate the data 
Data Visualization: Description of the dataset to get the basic insight on the data. 
4	Normalization of the Dataset: Prepare the data for Regression Algorithm (all the values should lie on the common scale) to make the interpretation easy.
Check how well the model fit the dataset by Computing the Loss Function.
Split the Dataset into training and testing Dataset 
Apply The Relevant Algorithm to find out
1.	Predict the average sales by product
2.	Predict the sales of product for every outlet
5	Evaluate the Model: Compute the accuracy between Actual values and Predicted Values.
